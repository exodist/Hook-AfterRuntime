NAME
    Hook::AfterRuntime - Run code at the end of the compiling scope's
    runtime.

DESCRIPTION
    Useful for creating modules that need a behavior to be added when a
    module that uses them completes it's runtime. Like B::Hooks::EndOfScope
    except it triggers for run-time instead of compile-time.

    Example where it might be handy:

        #!/usr/bin/perl
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use Moose;

        ...

        # It would be nice not to need this....
        __PACKAGE__->make_immutable;

SYNOPSYS
    MooseX/AutoImmute.pm

        package MooseX::AutoImmute;
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use Hook::AfterRuntime;

        sub import {
            my $class = shift;
            my $caller = caller;
            eval "package $caller; use Moose; 1" || die $@;
            after_runtime { $caller->make_immutable }
        }

        1;

    t/mytest.t

        #!/usr/bin/perl
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use MooseX::AutoImmute;

        ....

        #EOF
        # Package is now immutable autamatically

SEE ALSO
    B::Hooks::EndOfScope
        Does almost the same thing, except it is triggered after
        compile-time instead of run-time.

FENNEC PROJECT
    This module is part of the Fennec project. See Fennec for more details.
    Fennec is a project to develop an extendable and powerful testing
    framework. Together the tools that make up the Fennec framework provide
    a potent testing environment.

    The tools provided by Fennec are also useful on their own. Sometimes a
    tool created for Fennec is useful outside the greator framework. Such
    tools are turned into their own projects. This is one such project.

    Fennec - The core framework
      The primary Fennec project that ties them all together.
